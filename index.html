                        has decreased. Stock prices have been falling
                        due to poor quality of code and wholesale.
                        Others may also be present virtually, both in name
                        and spirit. What follows is a list of those who

                    1. From Last Time:
                </h3>
                <h4>
                    Improving the Spread of Ideas:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    One of the key points we left off at during our last meeting
                    was a request for more freedom to adopt
                    new ideas in the work place. Aaron had mentioned
                    the following technology, innovated elsewhere but taken to its 
                    maximum potential in the heart of the Silicon Valley:

                    <figcaption><b> Fig. #1: The Sticky Note</b></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    What you see in the above image is an example of a place for both creative
                    freedom and modularization. It is this latter point which we wish to now hit home.
                    One such item, a single sticky note, is useful for conveying one idea 
                    directly between coworkers. However, after examining the leading
                    forecast of our primary contenders, we have decided to implement
                    a greater strategy, which also involves the following:
                </p>

                    <img src="media/pexelsWhiteboard.jpg" alt="A whiteboard"

                    <figcaption><b> Fig. #2: A Whiteboard</b></figcaption>

                <div id="flexCont">
                    <p>
                        From our research team headed by Thwo and Vig, we have reason to 
                        believe that though drawing directly on this device can aid complex
                        reasoning, that if we instead draw on these "sticky notes" and
                        <em> then </em> put them on this white board, that productivity increases
                        by nearly two-fold. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What should be noted, as mentioned earlier, is how individual ideas
                        can now be put in a space where all can view them. This creates
                        a potential network through which information can flow and interact,
                        yielding a space that is then in turn democratized by this revolution
                        of discussion and decision-making. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Phar had brought up last time, by putting all our ideas here, we
                        can then decide on the best paths forward by collectively examining
                        sticky notes posted on this board.
                    </p>
                    <p> It should be noted, however, that we are still working both the sticky
                        notes and required pens into our budget. (There are a handful of
                        small start up companies that have gone under down the street, however,
                        and so we may acquire some of these from them. Though we may follow in 
                        their footsteps, we will not make the same mistakes.)
                        We do currently have enough, however, for at least two of the three teams.

                            We additionally were considering last time that our tables be put on wheels,
                            and that all privacy of the cubicle be removed. This was previously voted
                            down by our research team, but as we then discussed, since our financial
                            state has only been worsening and we have yet to try it, we have put it back
                            on the table for future discussion. This will be reviewed again in a week's time.

                            of plushy foam on computer vision systems. As mentioned last time,
                            this was the next material in line after the bicycle accident last week.

                            as before described. It is important we emphasize now, however,
                            it's use in providing a platform through which we may all comingle.
                            Miye is currently leading a small group to automate the mitigation
                            of conflicts such that the longer piece of code is selected in case

                        New Projects Just in:
                    </h4>
                    <p> We have recieved two new projects: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Music and Machine Learning</li>
                        <li> Garbage Disposal</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The first of these has been handed to us by DubSteppers4Lyfe
                        Recording Studios, Ltd. They wish to take hits of previous
                        decades with which to test against incoming songs. The idea
                        is to design a system through which they release the next
                        greatest hits, and maximize their profits. (In case 
                        any members of our teams need reminding, this would
                        be a very good thing for us.) They have offered us
                        3% of the first three hits they make, with further
                        revenue still in negotiation. Considering the situation
                        we find ourselves in, this is quite a good deal.

                    <div>
                        In particular, they would like us to construct our
                        learning system based on the following classics:
                        <ol>

                        The recording studio wishes we priortize our algorithm to similarities with
                        the songs in the above order. Additionally, we are in communication with them
                        about getting more material, since we realize there are too few songs
                        here to reasonably build from. They are in the process of retrieving more,
                        but have voiced their concern over having these emphasized above all else.
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The second project could likely be one of our more long-term, fruitful 
                        endeavours. We have been reached out to by a utility company for writing
                        an application through which they may optimize their garbage trucks'
                        arrival and delivery times. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The company currently has only five vehicles and three staff members,
                        but should this start-up prospect gain even 1% of the market,
                        we stand to see revenue of the likes we have never seen.

                        The Matter of Our Financial State:
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        As you are all aware, things have not been looking somewhat down
                        for our company in terms of profits (<strong> if nothing
                        else </strong>). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this reason, we are working on gathering data related to 
                        what factor(s) have been the primary culprit(s) for our stock numbers.
                        Statistics are currently still coming in, but it seems that a layoff
                        of non-essential workers may be required.

                        Here we'd like to briefly describe a new philosophy for success of
                        both profits and software that our research team has been working on
                        for six months now. To convey this information most effectively,
                        we have put it into a video (found below). If the video fails to load
                        or otherwise you prefer audio-only, an audio file from the video can
